# CPP STL 
 <br>
 The <b>Standard Template Library (STL)</b> is a software library for the C++ programming language that influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library. It provides four components called <b>algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators.</b><br>
 <br>
 The STL provides a set of common classes for C++, such as containers and associative arrays, that can be used with any built-in type and with any user-defined type that supports some elementary operations (such as copying and assignment). STL algorithms are independent of containers, which significantly reduces the complexity of the library.<br>
